# Reliability
The parameters describing the material properties varies within a range, so while designing a structure these variability should be taken into account.

The project report can be found in "Reliablity report.pdf" and the problem statement can be found in "wing_full.pdf"

In this project a wing made of composite material whose density, layer 1 and layer 2 thickness varies in a range. By including changes due to this variance optimal parameter setting for 6 sigma level is found out using RBDO method (Reliability Based Design Optimization). This is tested using Monte Carlo simulation.
